        <p>Lets talk about anime. In my opinion, anime is great. I watch pretty much every to every other day and it's loads of fun. My favorites right now are probably One Piece and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The reason I like these animes so much is because of the author's interests in western culture. When it comes to pirates, fashion, language, race, etc. I am trying to keep a diversity of different style animes but I mostly like action pact shows. One Piece is amazing because first of all, it has over 1,000 episodes, second the main character and his crew have so much developement in their stories and when it all comes together in this big fight, its truly amazing. These animes I have been talking about are part of the older generation of anime, but the animation production is still going on to this day. One Piece is currently past 1,000 episodes and are still going. David Production is currently working on animating the sixth part(Stone Ocean) of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure right now, and in December of 2021, they released the first part of Stone Ocean with 12 episodes, exclusively on Netflix.   </p>
